IconFonts Bolt Extension
======================

An extension which offers a basic twig function to create HTML i elements for use with fonts and icons, as the backend editor removes those items.  The function is of the format

Size is a valid CSS value.  If you want to use pre-built classes like fa-2x, simply add them to the classes string.
